### About Me

![](images/sherica.jpg){fig-align="center" width="229"}

I'm Sherica Chua, an aspiring architect and passionate creative mind with a unique vision. From a young age, I've been entranced by the profound impact that architecture has on our lives and the world around us. This fascination has been the driving force behind my journey to pursue a Bachelor of Architecture, where I explore the art of shaping spaces that inspire, comfort, and serve the needs of our communities.

In addition to my architectural pursuits, my heart beats for art and design. This love for aesthetics and user-centered creativity has led me to pursue a minor in UX/UI design. I find immense joy in connecting with people and crafting experiences that resonate with them. My motivation in creating, whether it's through architectural wonders or intuitive digital interfaces, is rooted in the user---designing for their needs, desires, and emotions.

Join me in this exploration of the intersection between the physical and digital worlds, where architecture and UX/UI design blend seamlessly to shape the environments of today and tomorrow. Together, let's create spaces and experiences that leave a lasting impact on our lives.

Welcome to my world of design, where every project is a canvas for innovation and a testament to the power of thoughtful, user-centered creation.
