    "text": "I’m Sherica Chua, an aspiring architect and passionate creative mind with a unique vision. From a young age, I’ve been entranced by the profound impact that architecture has on our lives and the world around us. This fascination has been the driving force behind my journey to pursue a Bachelor of Architecture, where I explore the art of shaping spaces that inspire, comfort, and serve the needs of our communities.\nIn addition to my architectural pursuits, my heart beats for art and design. This love for aesthetics and user-centered creativity has led me to pursue a minor in UX/UI design. I find immense joy in connecting with people and crafting experiences that resonate with them. My motivation in creating, whether it’s through architectural wonders or intuitive digital interfaces, is rooted in the user—designing for their needs, desires, and emotions.\nJoin me in this exploration of the intersection between the physical and digital worlds, where architecture and UX/UI design blend seamlessly to shape the environments of today and tomorrow. Together, let’s create spaces and experiences that leave a lasting impact on our lives.\nWelcome to my world of design, where every project is a canvas for innovation and a testament to the power of thoughtful, user-centered creation.\nVIEW CV 2021\n____"

TELL YOU more about it!\n\n\n\nAccording to studies on urban forestry and sustainability, the state of a city’s tree population can significantly impact the environment, air quality, and overall well-being of its residents. For instance, research by the United Nations has shown that urban green spaces, including trees, are vital for mitigating climate change. This question is important because understanding how San Francisco’s tree population has evolved is crucial for assessing the city’s progress in environmental sustainability and urban planning, which has wide-reaching effects on residents’ quality of life.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Enter code here\n# Load required libraries\nlibrary(radiant)\n\nLoading required package: radiant.data\n\n\nLoading required package: magrittr\n\n\nLoading required package: ggplot2\n\n\nLoading required package: lubridate\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'lubridate'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    date, intersect, setdiff, union\n\n\nLoading required package: tidyr\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'tidyr'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:magrittr':\n\n    extract\n\n\nLoading required package: dplyr\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'radiant.data'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:lubridate':\n\n    month, wday\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:ggplot2':\n\n    diamonds\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:magrittr':\n\n    set_attr\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:base':\n\n    date\n\n\nLoading required package: radiant.design\n\n\nLoading required package: radiant.basics\n\n\nLoading required package: radiant.model\n\n\nLoading required package: radiant.multivariate\n\nlibrary(radiant.data)\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(leaflet)  # Load the 'leaflet' package\nlibrary(ggplot2)  # Load the 'ggplot2' package\n\n# Load the dataset\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-01-28/sf_trees.csv\")\n\n# Define UI\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n  # User interface components, e.g., input controls, filters\n  selectInput(\"species\", \"Select Tree Species\", \n              choices = c(\"All\", unique(data$species_name)), \n              selected = \"All\"),  # Set a default value, e.g., \"All\"\n  plotOutput(\"line_chart\"),\n  plotOutput(\"bar_chart\"),\n  leafletOutput(\"map\")\n)\n\n# Define server\nserver &lt;- function(input, output) {\n  # Create a reactive dataset filtered by selected species\n  filtered_data &lt;- reactive({\n    if (input$species == \"All\") {\n      return(data)\n    } else {\n      return(subset(data, species_name == input$species))\n    }\n  })\n\n  # Create a time series line chart\n  output$line_chart &lt;- renderPlot({\n    ggplot(filtered_data(), aes(x = plant_date)) +\n      geom_line(aes(y = ..count..), stat = \"count\") +\n      labs(title = \"Tree Planting Over Time\", y = \"Number of Trees\", x = \"Planting Date\")\n  })\n\n  # Create a bar chart\n  output$bar_chart &lt;- renderPlot({\n    ggplot(filtered_data(), aes(x = reorder(species_name, -..count..), y = ..count..)) +\n      geom_bar() +\n      labs(title = \"Distribution of Tree Species\", y = \"Number of Trees\", x = \"Tree Species\") +\n      coord_flip()\n  })\n\n  # Create a geographic map\n  output$map &lt;- renderLeaflet({\n    m &lt;- leaflet(filtered_data()) %&gt;%\n      addTiles() %&gt;%\n      addMarkers(lat = ~latitude, lng = ~longitude, label = ~paste(\"Species: \", species_name))\n    m\n  })\n}\n\n# Run the Shiny app\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n\nShiny applications not supported in static R Markdown documents"
